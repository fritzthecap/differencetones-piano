        <h2>About Harmony</h2>
        <p>
            Harmony starts to exist when there is more than one tone playing simultaneously. 
            It also exists in melodies that play several different tones after each other, 
            but melodies are more about movement, they are a layer above harmony. 
            Humans perceive harmony as simple ratios (fractions) of frequencies. 
            The simpler these fractions are, the more beautiful they are perceived to be. 
            Doubling the frequency is perceived as the most harmonious interval, 
            the octave with fraction 2/1. The 3/2 fraction of a tone is the fifth, 
            also a simple and beautiful ratio, like 4/3 for the fourth. 
            The more complex the ratio is becoming, the more cultural is the perception
            of beauty in intervals. The major third as 5/4 may be the first that 
            is perceived as not so harmonious in some cultures, although it is 
            more acknowledged than the minor third with 6/5. The same as the thirds is
            about the wider intervals like minor sixth (8/5) and major sixth (5/3), 
            and finally with the minor seventh (16/9, 9/5, 7/4) and the major second (9/8, 10/9). 
            But the 12-tone scale is not the only one, already hundreds years ago 
            mathematicians recommended to use a 53-tone scale for perfect harmony. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The mathematician Pythagoras (570 â€“ 495 B.C.) has put fifth over fifth and 
            octaved down the resulting notes until the octave was filled with 12 tones. 
            He discovered that putting 12 fifth on top of each other
            does not result in 7 octaves like expected, well-known as the Pythagorean Comma. 
            His tuning system did not survive the 16th century in Europe, 
            when church organs were tuned to what today is called "just intonation". 
            Many more tunings were developed since to avoid "beatings" of organ bells, 
            resulting from <b>difference tones</b>. Today's resolution for the harmony-problem 
            is to prefer the "equal temperament", where all 12 semitones of an octave have
            the same distance from each other (namely 100 "cent", which is an artificial unit). 
            This distance can not be described by a simple integer fraction. 
            The "equal temperament" solution may also be related to technical advancement
            in many areas, trying to simplify everything. Fact is that "equal temperament"
            gave up perfect harmony in favor of musical freedom for composers and musicians. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Difference tones are shadow tones that sound when at least two notes 
            are played simultaneously. The higher these two notes, the easier one can
            hear the difference tones. The cleaner the playing instruments, 
            the clearer the difference tones, best perceivable through sine wave tones. 
            The more overtones the instruments have, the more do they obstruct the
            difference tones, nevertheless they are always there, and they are
            much lower than the generating high tones. The tighter the high notes
            are together, the deeper the difference tone gets. 
            For just intonation, most difference tones fit perfectly into the scale. 
            Not for equal temperament, where they are nearly all dissonant.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Another important fact is that equal temperament fits to all modulations and moves
            music can make, it offers unbound freedom. Not so just intonation. 
            A just scale is built on top of a specific base tone. So when you want to play in 
            just intonation, you will have to specify not only the type of your just scale, 
            but also the scale's base note. A just intonation scale is bound to 
            this base tone, all instruments have to tune themselves to this center, 
            and then to the type of scale. In equal temperament no such center exists. 
            Instruments have to tune themselves only to some reference frequency like 440 Hertz (A4).

            Musicians playing melody instruments like violin or saxophone do not have 
            to care so much about harmony. Most of them are well-trained to correct
            frequencies to the harmony playing in the background. 
            In other words, the art of playing a solo instrument is the art of perfectly 
            and quickly adapting to the context harmony through the flexible intonation 
            that these instruments always provide.
            It is different for a piano, a guitar or an organ that can  not adapt its tuning dynamically. 
            These instruments, mostly playing background, do have to care for harmony. 
            And if they can, the solo instrument will have to go with it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not that we always go forward, now with equal temperament, and that we can
            forget about just intonation. The latter is still widely used. 
            Choirs always use it, because it simply sounds better. 
            A violin player will always tune his instrument to just intonation, 
            except when using a tuning device, these mostly provide equal temperament. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Summary is that the harmony question is not so important in today's
            fast played and open-minded Jazz/Rock/Pop/Ethno/Fusion music in loud places
            with lots of background noise and small rooms. 
            But it matters a lot when coming into a silent big church room 
            for a quiet meditation, and the organ begins to play on pipes that generate beatings. 
            At any place where people come to listen, not to dance, harmony plays
            a great role, and after thousands years of thinking about tunings 
            the game is still not over. Today we know everything and use computers
            to find out the rest. But it turns out that the rest is much bigger
            than what we know. The knowledge about music is immense, and nobody
            can read in just one life all the literature that has been written about it. 
            So if that knowledge finally bursts and gives way to the desire of music lovers 
            for simplicity and harmony, we will continue to search for it.
