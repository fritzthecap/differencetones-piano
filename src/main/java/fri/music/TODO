- The NotesOnPianoPlayer needs a better Start/Stop control button group.
    With a single-step mode, one can observe the pressed piano keys note by note.
    For the single step mode, the just performed note should be selected in textarea.
    The 5 buttons will be:
    "Start" should turn itself into "Stop" and play the melody beginning at the recently played note.
    "Stop" should stop the melody and remember (store) the currently playing note.
    "Step Backward" or "Step Forward" should step to previous or next note, play it and stop there.
    When playing and one of "Step Backward" or "Step Forward" is pressed, the playing should be stopped.
    Being stopped, at start position, "Step Backward" should be disabled, "Step Forward" enabled.
    Being stopped, at end position, "Step Backward" should be enabled, "Step Forward" disabled.
    "Rewind" should stop and go to start, it is disabled when being at start.
    "Fast Forward" should stop and go to end, it is disabled when being at end.
 
- Somehow visualize intervals for difference tones,
    e.g. all intervals that generate "C4" should be displayed as piano keys.
    See DifferenceToneInversions. 
    As preliminary work, a piano would be needed that lets press
    a number of keyboard keys via constructor.  

- Must be able to load and save melodies (from/to files, or predefined String resources) 
    in NotesPiano.

- Provide an "Export to ABC" button that writes notes in ABC format
    and renders the result in a non-modal text-dialog.
    For NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer, this would also generate 
    the according difference-tone intervals ("inversions")
    in a separate note-line above.

- Configuration and display UI for:
    Tunings with frequency and cent (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo)
    Difference tones in different tunings (DifferenceToneDemo)
    Difference tone inversions in different tunings (DifferenceToneInversionsDemo)
    
- Documentation UI, leading through different topics.
    This should be in foreground initially, but can be made optional
    for all introduction-dialogs through a checkbox "Never show introductions".
    When this checkbox gets clicked, not a single introduction 
    dialog will show anywhere anymore. Main menu offers an action to
    reverse that setting.

    Running the application opens main documentation. Then different
    buttons provide insights:
    "See and Hear Difference Tones" (FrequencyDifferenceSliders, DifferenceToneForIntervalPiano), 
    "Explore Beatings in Intervals of Different Tunings" (IntervalPlayingPiano),
    "Test Chords in Different Tunings" (TriadPlayingPiano, FrequencyChordSliders),
    "See Difference Tones on Piano" (DifferenceTonePiano), 
    "Explore Tone Systems", or "See Frequencies, Cent, IPN names and MIDI numbers" (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo, ...), 
    "Check Just Intonation" (JustIntonationChecker), 
    "Translate a Melody into Difference Tones" (DifferenceToneInversions, DefaultComposer, NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer), 
    "Look at Pianos" (PianoConfiguration), 
    "Try out Wave Generators" (WavePianoDemo, PianoConfiguration),
