- The export from NotesWithDifferenceToneInversionsPianoPlayer 
    to ABC would require two voices, the lower one with the tune,
    the upper one with its difference tone intervals.

- The titles of demo apps should be also visible when running
    pianos from ConfigurationPanel.
    A "Help" button in configuration panel should document the 
    different pianos available here.
    
- Configuration and display UI for:
    NotesPianoPlayer and all sub-classes
    Tunings with frequency and cent (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo)
    Difference tones in different tunings (DifferenceToneDemo)
    Difference tone inversions in different tunings (DifferenceToneInversionsDemo)
    
- Documentation UI, leading through different topics.
    This should be in foreground initially, but can be made optional
    for all introduction-dialogs through a checkbox "Never show introductions".
    When this checkbox gets clicked, not a single introduction 
    dialog will show anywhere anymore. Main menu offers an action to
    reverse that setting.

    Running the application opens main documentation. Then different
    buttons provide insights:
    "See and Hear Difference Tones" (FrequencyDifferenceSliders, DifferenceToneForIntervalPiano), 
    "Explore Beatings in Intervals of Different Tunings" (IntervalPlayingPiano),
    "Test Chords in Different Tunings" (TriadPlayingPiano, FrequencyChordSliders),
    "See Difference Tones on Piano" (DifferenceTonePiano), 
    "Explore Tone Systems", or "See Frequencies, Cent, IPN names and MIDI numbers" (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo, ...), 
    "Check Just Intonation" (JustIntonationChecker), 
    "Translate a Melody into Difference Tones" (DifferenceToneInversions, DefaultComposer, NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer), 
    "Look at Pianos" (PianoConfiguration), 
    "Try out Wave Generators" (WavePianoDemo, PianoConfiguration), 
    TODO: there is more!

==============================

Fixed Bugs:

    - Bug NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer: LIMIT_17, FOURTH-FIFTH, deviation 76 %.
        A4 and D#5 should generate G3, but no difference tone appears on piano.
        
        Fixed by removing the assumptive calculation of derivation when 
        no deeper tone is present than the one in quest. Returning null in that case now.
        Had to adapt a DefaultComposerTest case for this.
    
    - Bug in Piano ConfigurationPanel, happens when you choose 10 octaves starting on 5th:
        Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 
        The midiNoteNumber 197 could not be found in Tones, 10 octaves, range C0(12) - C10(132)
        
        DONE: by restricting the octave sliders to mutual maximum values.

    - Big problem: where does a triplet end?
        Every note of the triplet has a length and the triplet tag,
        but when there are two triplet groups in succession, where does the first triplet group end?
    
    - NotesPianoPlayer bug: Format button does not auto-break too long notes
        across bar end.
        
        DONE: exception is thrown in this case by MelodyFactory.

    - Bug: dotted chords are wrongly translated to ABC,
        the ">" has to be appended to chord, not to notes inside.
        
        DONE: see unit-test severalDottedChords()
