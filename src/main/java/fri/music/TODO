    dialog will show anywhere anymore. Main menu offers an action to
    reverse that setting.

    buttons provide insights:

    "See Difference Tones on Piano" (DifferenceTonePiano), 
    "Explore Tone Systems", or "See Frequencies, Cent, IPN names and MIDI numbers" (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo, ...), 
    "Check Just Intonation" (JustIntonationChecker), 
    "Translate a Melody into Difference Tones" (DifferenceToneInversions, Composer)
    "Look at Pianos" (PianoConfiguration), 
    "Try out Wave Generators" (WavePianoDemo, PianoConfiguration),
