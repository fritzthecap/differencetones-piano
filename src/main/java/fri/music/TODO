- Notes of intervals clicked in DifferenceToneInversionsPiano 
    should be written into a second text-area,
    see (unfinished) NotesWithDifferenceToneInversionsPianoPlayerDemo.
    The second text-area should also have player controls.
    Maybe open another piano-window for that?

- Provide a converter of MelodyFactory notes to ABC format.
    This should be available via context menu in any notes text area.

- Provide an "Export to ABC" button that writes notes in ABC format
    and renders the result in a non-modal text-dialog.
    For NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer, this would also generate 
    the according difference-tone intervals ("inversions")
    in a separate note-line above.

- Configuration and display UI for:
    Tunings with frequency and cent (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo)
    Difference tones in different tunings (DifferenceToneDemo)
    Difference tone inversions in different tunings (DifferenceToneInversionsDemo)
    
- Must be able to load and save melodies (from/to files, or predefined String resources) 
    in NotesPiano.

- Documentation UI, leading through different topics.
    This should be in foreground initially, but can be made optional
    for all introduction-dialogs through a checkbox "Never show introductions".
    When this checkbox gets clicked, not a single introduction 
    dialog will show anywhere anymore. Main menu offers an action to
    reverse that setting.

    Running the application opens main documentation. Then different
    buttons provide insights:
    "See and Hear Difference Tones" (FrequencyDifferenceSliders, DifferenceToneForIntervalPiano), 
    "Explore Beatings in Intervals of Different Tunings" (IntervalPlayingPiano),
    "Test Chords in Different Tunings" (TriadPlayingPiano, FrequencyChordSliders),
    "See Difference Tones on Piano" (DifferenceTonePiano), 
    "Explore Tone Systems", or "See Frequencies, Cent, IPN names and MIDI numbers" (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo, ...), 
    "Check Just Intonation" (JustIntonationChecker), 
    "Translate a Melody into Difference Tones" (DifferenceToneInversions, DefaultComposer, NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer), 
    "Look at Pianos" (PianoConfiguration), 
    "Try out Wave Generators" (WavePianoDemo, PianoConfiguration), 
    TODO: there is more!


Fixed Bugs

    - Bug NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer: LIMIT_17, FOURTH-FIFTH, deviation 76 %.
        A4 and D#5 should generate G3, but no difference tone appears on piano.
