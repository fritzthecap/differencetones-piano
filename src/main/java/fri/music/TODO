Display difference tones on a sine-wave piano.

Display high notes variants when playing a low tone as difference tone,
    on SineWavePiano.
    
Scale builder: build a 12-tone scale from different variants of all intervals.
    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament#Table
    
Let make a self-built scale available as tuning for TuneablePiano.

Comparison of just-intonation scales with the equal temperament scale.
    (Kind of that has been implemented in JustIntonation.centDeviation)

Optimizer for just-intonation that combines different available interval variants
    to find a 12-tone scale with no unjust intervals and no unjust difference tones.
    Most music pieces do not use all 12 semitones, they just deviate into maybe 2 or 3
    other keys. I want to find a scale for a given set of semitones that has the least
    dissonant difference tones and unequal (unjust) intervals.
