 
- Somehow visualize intervals for difference tones,
    e.g. all intervals that generate "C3" should be displayed and 
    optionally be played as piano keys on one interval item.
    See DifferenceToneInversions. 
    A piano with TuningComponent and DeviationComponent must be present,
    also choosers for narrowest and widest interval.
    Pressing a piano key would display a list of up to 8 difference-tone inversion intervals.
    Clicking onto one of the interval-items would play the interval and mark the resulting
    difference-tone with a red-border. DifferenceToneForNotesPiano should be reusable for this.

- Must be able to load and save melodies (from/to files, or predefined String resources) 
    in NotesPiano.

- Provide an "Export to ABC" button that writes notes in ABC format
    and renders the result in a non-modal text-dialog.
    For NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer, this would also generate 
    the according difference-tone intervals ("inversions")
    in a separate note-line above.

- Configuration and display UI for:
    Tunings with frequency and cent (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo)
    Difference tones in different tunings (DifferenceToneDemo)
    Difference tone inversions in different tunings (DifferenceToneInversionsDemo)
    
- Documentation UI, leading through different topics.
    This should be in foreground initially, but can be made optional
    for all introduction-dialogs through a checkbox "Never show introductions".
    When this checkbox gets clicked, not a single introduction 
    dialog will show anywhere anymore. Main menu offers an action to
    reverse that setting.

    Running the application opens main documentation. Then different
    buttons provide insights:
    "See and Hear Difference Tones" (FrequencyDifferenceSliders, DifferenceToneForIntervalPiano), 
    "Explore Beatings in Intervals of Different Tunings" (IntervalPlayingPiano),
    "Test Chords in Different Tunings" (TriadPlayingPiano, FrequencyChordSliders),
    "See Difference Tones on Piano" (DifferenceTonePiano), 
    "Explore Tone Systems", or "See Frequencies, Cent, IPN names and MIDI numbers" (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo, ...), 
    "Check Just Intonation" (JustIntonationChecker), 
    "Translate a Melody into Difference Tones" (DifferenceToneInversions, DefaultComposer, NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer), 
    "Look at Pianos" (PianoConfiguration), 
    "Try out Wave Generators" (WavePianoDemo, PianoConfiguration),
