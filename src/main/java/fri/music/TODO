- The NotesOnPianoPlayer needs a better Start/Stop control button group.
    "Start" should enable initially disabled "Backward" and "Forward" buttons and turn itself into "Stop".
    "Stop" should rewind the melody and disable "Backward" and "Forward".
    Pressing "Backward" or "Forward" should step to next or previous note and stop there.
    For the single step mode, the just performed notes need to be selected in textarea.
    With a single-step button, one can observe the pressed piano keys note by note.
 
- Somehow visualize intervals for difference tones,
    e.g. all intervals that generate "C4" should be displayed as piano keys.
    See DifferenceToneInversions. 
    As preliminary work a piano would be needed that lets press
    a number of keyboard keys via constructor.  

- Must be able to load and save melodies (from/to files, or predefined strings) 
    in NotesPiano.

- Provide an "Export to ABC" button that writes notes in ABC format
    and renders the result in a non-modal text-dialog.
    For NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer, this would generate intervals.

- Give DifferenceToneForIntervalPiano and others an initial interval or chord to play.

- Display 
    of Tunings with frequency and cent
    of difference tones in different tunings
    of difference tone inversions in different tunings
    
- Documentation UI, leading through different topics.
    This should be in foreground initially, but can be made optional
    for all introduction-dialogs through a checkbox "Never show introductions".
    When this checkbox gets clicked, not a single introduction 
    dialog will show anywhere anymore. Main menu offers an action to
    reverse that setting.

    Running the application opens main documentation. Then different
    buttons provide insights:
    "See and Hear Difference Tones" (FrequencyDifferenceSliders, DifferenceToneForIntervalPiano), 
    "Explore Beatings in Intervals of Different Tunings" (IntervalPlayingPiano),
    "Test Chords in Different Tunings" (TriadPlayingPiano, FrequencyChordSliders),
    "See Difference Tones on Piano" (DifferenceTonePiano), 
    "Explore Tone Systems", or "See Frequencies, Cent, IPN names and MIDI numbers" (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo, ...), 
    "Check Just Intonation" (JustIntonationChecker), 
    "Translate a Melody into Difference Tones" (DifferenceToneInversions, DefaultComposer, NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer), 
    "Look at Pianos" (PianoConfiguration), 
    "Try out Wave Generators" (WavePianoDemo, PianoConfiguration),
