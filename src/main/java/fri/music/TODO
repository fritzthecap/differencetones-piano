- Play a Tone array (written for MelodyFactory) visibly on any piano.
    Provide a text-area where the user can choose from prepared melodies
    or input a new melody. 

- Display 
    of Tunings with frequency and cent
    of difference tones in different tunings
    of difference tone inversions in different tunings
    
- Documentation UI, leading through different topics.
    This should be in foreground initially, but can be made optional
    for all introduction-dialogs through a checkbox "Never show introductions".
    When this checkbox gets clicked, not a single introduction 
    dialog will show anywhere anymore. Main menu offers an action to
    reverse that setting.

    Running the application opens main documentation. Then different
    buttons provide insights:
    "Hear Difference Tones" (FrequencyDifferenceSliders), 
    "See Difference Tones" (DifferenceTonePiano), 
    "Explore Beatings in Tunings" (TriadPlayingPiano),
    "Look at Pianos" (PianoConfiguration), 
    "Check Just Intonation" (JustIntonationChecker), 
    "Translate a Melody into Difference Tones" (DifferenceToneInversions, Composer)
