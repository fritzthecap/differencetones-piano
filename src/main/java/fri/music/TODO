- NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer must export both intervals and notes to ABC.

- Create deployment: Maven packer job to generate JAR file.
    Try out JAR file (whether hyperlink resolution works).
    
- Find out why the first interval in auto-composed "When the Saints" is so high.
    Maybe the tone-range calculation is wrong or could be improved?

- Configuration and display UI for:
    Tunings with frequency and cent (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo)
    Difference tones in different tunings (DifferenceToneDemo)
    Difference tone inversions in different tunings (DifferenceToneInversionsDemo)
    
- Documentation:
    Write empty HTML docs.
    New docs for "Explore Tone Systems", or "See Frequencies, Cent, IPN names and MIDI numbers" 
    (EqualTemperamentDemo, JustIntonationDemo, ...). 

- Selection of notes in text-area while playing, for NotesPianoPlayer.
    This should work only in single-step mode.

- Test, test, test! And fix found bugs.

==============================

Fixed Bugs:

- Bug: tied subsequent notes are rendered as their own interval list.
    They should go with their lead tie.
    Reproduction: load "When the saints", click "Auto-Compose".
    DONE: fixed via RestIgnoringNoteIterator.

- Bug: ESCAPE on dialogs does not work anymore - DialogUtil.
    DONE: replaced KeyListener by getInputMap and getActionMap calls. 

- Bug: "Back" does not work after internal jump to anchor and then going back.
    Page should be at 0/0 but does not move on "Back".
    DONE: is a JEditorPane bug, fixed by explicitly doing scrollRectToVisible() in "Back".
    
- Bug: JEditorPane does not display image any more when increasing font size.
    Reproduction: run Main and click "Ctrl +".
    DONE: fixed by setBase() and putProperty() in updateFontSizes) In HtmlViewActions

- Bug in NotesWithDifferenceToneInversionsPianoPlayer:
    When appending an interval to end of text, it is written in next text line instead of same.
    Only when bar is full it should be written into next line.
    DONE: fixed by formatting notes after insertion of a new interval.
    
- Bug WrapLayout: 
    - add 1 list frame by clicking onto C 
    - detach dialog
    - resize the dialog to have just one column, 
        vertical scrollbar must be showing,
        horizontal scrollbar must NOT be showing
    - add another frame by clicking onto D
    => a second scrollbar is showing to the left of the original one.
    DONE: you must call revalidate() on the scrollpane's parent, then it works.
          Could not replace the vertical strut (heightHolder) by setPreferredSize(),
          then scrollbars would never show!
    
- Bug NotesWithDifferenceTonePianoPlayer: LIMIT_17, FOURTH-FIFTH, deviation 76 %.
    A4 and D#5 should generate G3, but no difference tone appears on piano.
    
    Fixed by removing the assumptive calculation of derivation when 
    no deeper tone is present than the one in quest. Returning null in that case now.
    Had to adapt a DefaultComposerTest case for this.

- Bug in Piano ConfigurationPanel, happens when you choose 10 octaves starting on 5th:
    Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 
    The midiNoteNumber 197 could not be found in Tones, 10 octaves, range C0(12) - C10(132)
    DONE: by restricting the octave sliders to mutual maximum values.

- Big problem: where does a triplet end?
    Every note of the triplet has a length and the triplet tag,
    but when there are two triplet groups in succession, where does the first triplet group end?

- Bug NotesPianoPlayer: Format button does not auto-break too long notes
    across bar end.
    DONE: exception is thrown in this case by MelodyFactory.

- Bug: dotted chords are wrongly translated to ABC,
    the ">" has to be appended to chord, not to notes inside.
    DONE: see unit-test severalDottedChords()
