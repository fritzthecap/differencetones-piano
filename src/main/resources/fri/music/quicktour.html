        <p>This is about composing difference-tone intervals for a melody.
        
        <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Click the top-left button <i>"Compose Difference-Tone Intervals for a Melody"</i>.
            A new window opens.</p>
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            <p>In the new window, right-click into the top <b>left</b> text-area 
            and click "Load Examples" in the context-menu. Select "Ode to Joy", 
            this is in the key of F, use "Transpose" to move it to another key.</p>
            <p>Notes are in text-area now.
                Interval lists fill the lower part of the UI that was initially empty.
                Their number is the same as the number of notes in the melody.</p>
        </li>
        <ul><li>
            <p>Optionally you can play the melody now by clicking the "Play Notes" player button
            on top left, this is the 4th button from left. Click it again to stop the playback.</p>
        </li></ul>
        <li>
            <p>Click "Auto-Compose" on the very right.
            The top <b>right</b> text-area is filled with intervals now.
            In the interval lists below the auto-composed intervals are selected.</p>
        </li>
        <ul><li>
            <p>Optionally you can play the intervals by clicking the "Play Notes" player button
            on top right. This will play the intervals, not the difference-tones.
            The piano keyboard displays any 'pressed' key and marks the resulting difference-tone
            with a red border. (Although it looks like, it does NOT play it!)
            Listen carefully. You should hear the melody sound below the intervals.</p>
        </li></ul>
        <li>
            <p>Click "ABC Export" below the top right text-area. A dialog opens.
            Select an "ABC Converter" on botton right, the selected web-address
            will be copied to the system clipboard automatically.
            Go to your web-browser and paste (Ctrl-V) the address in its address-line on top.</p>
            <p>Go back to the dialog. 
            Enter "Title", "Key", "Author", "Date" fields and click "Translate" on bottom.
            The new content of the right-side text-area 
            gets copied to the system clipboard automatically.</p>
            <p>Go to your web-browser and paste (Ctrl-V) the ABC notes into the according area.
            Printable notes should be rendered by the ABC converter now, like the ones below:</p>

        </li><br/>
        <li>
            <p>You can see that the intervals for 9th and 10th tone (F4) are quite high
                in relation to all other notes. The algorithm's calculations went 'wrong'.
                You want to correct that manually.</p>
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            <p>Close the "Export" dialog. 
                To change all occurrences of F4 with one click, find the "Reuse Open Lists"
                on bottom left and deactivate it. The number of interval-lists will reduce dramatically
                to just 5 different notes of the melody.
                You can also activate the "Sort Lists by Pitch" checkbox 
                to get the F4 interval list to the left side.
            </p>
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            <p>In the F4 list, click onto the second interval from top, which is "C6 F6".
                All occurrences of F4 in the top right intervals text-area will change.
            </p>
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            <p>Once again click the right-side "ABC Export". The recently entered properties
                like "Title" are already there, you can immediately go to your web-browser
                and paste the automatically copied ABC notes.
                Result should be this:

        <li>
            <p>Why is the "Tuning" on the notes?
                Difference-tones depend on tuning. 
                If you'd play these intervals in another tuning than <i>EqualTemperament</i>,
                the melody would sound wrong.
                You'd get different intervals if you chose a <i>JustIntonation</i>
                tuning in the top bar on the left side. 
                All three of "Tuning", "Deviation", "Narrowest/Widest Interval" 
                affect the set of possible intervals for a difference-tone.
