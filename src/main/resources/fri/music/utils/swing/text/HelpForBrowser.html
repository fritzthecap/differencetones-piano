<h1 id="Browser">Swing HTML Browser Help</h1>
<p>
This is an HTML browser, not a web browser.
Links starting with "http" will be opened in an external web browser, all others in this view.
You can see the target of any link in its tooltip on mouse-over.
</p>
<p>
To close a "Help" window, press the ESCAPE key, or click top right corner.
</p>

<h2 id="Font">Font Magnification</h2>
<p>
You can <b>magnify or reduce the text font</b> at any time
using "Ctr +" or "Ctrl -" or the context menu on the text-area.
Once this was done, all views opened afterwards will show the same font sizes. 
</p>

<h2 id="Chapters">Chapters Overview</h2>
<p>
The "Chapters:" overview in top toolbar lists all headings and elements 
with <i>id</i> in the displayed documentation. 
Opening the choice and clicking an item will jump to the selected chapter.
This is a regular navigation, so "Back" and "Forward" will work as expected afterwards.
</p>

<h2 id="Navigation">Navigation</h2>
<p>
There are four navigation buttons:
</p>
<ol>
<li>"Back" will go back to the previously viewed document</li>
<li>"Up" will jump to the start-point of your navigation</li>
<li>"Forward" will go to the document from where you went "Back"</li>
<li>"Reload" will refresh the current documentation from storage.</li>
</ol>
