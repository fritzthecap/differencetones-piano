        <h2>Application Limitations</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
            This project is educational. 
            Its intention was not production of anything other than knowledge,
            although you can use it to compose intervals that will play a melody as difference-tones. 
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            You can produce small pieces of music and print them via ABC, 
            but the application is not equipped to process big compositions with hundreds of note lines.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            The application has no load- or save-actions that access the hard-disk.
            Any data you want to keep you must save to and load from an external text editor via copy and paste.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            There is a facility to <b>export</b> data to 
            <a href="https://notabc.app/abc-converter/">ABC</a> notation language,
            but <b>no means to import</b> from ABC.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            This project is restricted to 12-tone scales.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            You can not try out your own 12-tone scale
            unless you implement it and recompile the project.
            In other words, currently there is no tool for building scales dynamically at runtime. 
            If you want to implement a new 12-tone scale, then 
            implement interface <code>ToneSystem</code> or
            extend <code>AbstractToneSystem</code> or <code>AbstractJustIntonation</code>. 
            For the latter, you simply can add new <code>Intervals</code> and <code>ChromaticScales</code> 
            to class <code>JustIntonation</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Computer keyboard support is provided very limited,
            no TAB-key order was implemented,
            mostly you will need the mouse for this user-interface.
            Although the piano, once having input focus, 
            could be played using TAB- or Shift-TAB and ENTER- or SPACE-keys,
            this seems to be not very practical.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            Although you can scale text fonts in all "Help" text views (like this one) 
            and "Notes" text areas, you can not scale the other fonts of the graphical user interface.
        </li><br/>
