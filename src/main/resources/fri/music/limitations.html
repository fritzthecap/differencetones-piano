            This project is educational. 
            Its intention is not production of anything other than knowledge,
            although you can freely use it to compose intervals that will play a 
            melody as difference-tones. 
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            The application is not equipped to process big melodies
            with hundreds of note lines.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            The application has no load- or save-actions that access the hard-disk.
            Any data you want to keep you must save to and load from an external 
            text editor via copy and paste.
            Also the application does not write anything, not even property files,
            to your hard-disk.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            The user-interface is not always synchronous with the sound playing,
            that means, the display of piano key strokes mostly lags behind the melody.
            To study the flow of melodies, use the single-step mode of the notes player.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            There is a facility to <b>export</b> data to 
            <a href="https://notabc.app/abc-converter/">ABC</a> notation language,
            but <b>no means to import</b> from ABC.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            This project is restricted to 12-tone scales.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            You can not try out your own 12-tone scale
            unless you implement it and recompile the project.
            In other words, currently there is no tool for building scales dynamically at runtime. 
            If you want to implement a new 12-tone scale, then 
            implement interface <code>ToneSystem</code> or
            extend <code>AbstractToneSystem</code> or <code>AbstractJustIntonation</code>. 
            For the latter, you simply can add new <code>Intervals</code> and <code>ChromaticScales</code> 
            to class <code>JustIntonation</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Computer keyboard support is provided very limited,
            no TAB-key order was implemented,
            mostly you will need the mouse for this user-interface.
            Although the piano, once having input focus, 
            could be played using TAB- or Shift-TAB and ENTER- or SPACE-keys,
            this seems to be not very practical.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            Although you can scale text fonts in all "Help" text views (like this one) 
            and "Notes" text areas, you can not scale the other fonts of the graphical user interface.
        </li><br/>
