            This project is educational. 
            Its intention is not production of anything other than knowledge,
            although you can freely use it to compose intervals that will play a 
            melody as difference-tones. 
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            The application has no load- or save-actions that access the hard-disk.
            Any data you want to keep you must save to and load from an external 
            text editor via copy and paste.
            Also the application does not write anything, not even property files,
            to your hard-disk.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            This project is <b>restricted to 12-tone scales</b>. 
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            You can not try out your own 12-tone scale
            unless you implement it and recompile the project.
            In other words, currently there is no tool for building scales dynamically at runtime. 
            If you want to implement a new 12-tone scale, then 
            implement interface <code>ToneSystem</code> or
            extend <code>AbstractToneSystem</code> or <code>AbstractJustIntonation</code>. 
            For the latter, you simply can add new <code>Intervals</code> and <code>ChromaticScales</code> 
            to class <code>JustIntonation</code>.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            There is a facility to <b>export</b> notes-text to the
            <a href="https://notabc.app/abc-converter/">ABC</a> notation language,
            but <b>no means to import</b> from ABC.<br/><br/>
            The application has its own way to write melodies as text.
            This notation has a very simple and readable syntax, 
            but is not designed to become a language with capabilities 
            like repeats, lyrics, multiple voices and all the things
            that traditional music notation (or ABC) can express. 
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            The user-interface is not always synchronous with the sound playing,
            that means, the display of piano key strokes mostly lags behind the sounding melody.
            To study the piano-key moves of a melody, use the single-step mode of the notes player
            or a very slow tempo (BPM).
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            Computer keyboard support is provided very limited,
            no TAB-key order was implemented,
            mostly you will need the mouse for this user-interface.
            Although the piano, once having input focus, 
            could be played using TAB- or Shift-TAB and ENTER- or SPACE-keys,
            this seems to be not very practical.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            Although you can scale text fonts in all "Help" text views (like this one) 
            and "Notes" text areas, you can not scale the other fonts of the graphical user interface.
