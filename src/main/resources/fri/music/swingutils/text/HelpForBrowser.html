<p>
This is an HTML-browser for viewing the documentations of this application.
</p>
<p>
You can magnify or reduce the text font at any time
using "Ctr +" or "Ctrl -" or the context menu on the text-area.
Once this was done, all views opened afterwards will show the same font sizes. 
</p>
<p>
HTTP-links will be opened in an external web-browser, all others in this view.
</p>

<h2 id="Chapters">Chapters</h2>
<p>
The "Chapters:" overview lists all headings and elements with <i>id</i> in the displayed documentation. 
Opening the choice and clicking an item will jump to the selected chapter.
This is a regular navigation, so "Back" and "Forward" will work as expected afterwards.
</p>

<h2 id="Navigation">Navigation</h2>

<li>"Reload" will refresh the current documentation from storage</li>
</ol>
