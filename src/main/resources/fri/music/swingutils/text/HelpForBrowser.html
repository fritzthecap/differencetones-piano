<h1 id="Browser">HTML Browser Help</h1>
<p>
This is an HTML browser, not a web browser.
Links starting with "http" will be opened in an external web browser, all others in this view.
The tooltip on any link will display you its target.
</p>
<p>
To close a "Help" window, press the ESCAPE key, or click top right corner.
</p>

<h2 id="Font">Font Magnifiction</h2>
<p>
You can <b>magnify or reduce the text font</b> at any time
using "Ctr +" or "Ctrl -" or the context menu on the text-area.
Once this was done, all views opened afterwards will show the same font sizes. 
</p>

<h2 id="Chapters">Chapters Overview</h2>
<p>
The "Chapters:" overview in top toolbar lists all headings and elements 
with <i>id</i> in the displayed documentation. 
Opening the choice and clicking an item will jump to the selected chapter.
This is a regular navigation, so "Back" and "Forward" will work as expected afterwards.
</p>

<h2 id="Navigation">Navigation</h2>
<p>
There are four navigation buttons:
</p>
<ol>
<li>"Back" will go back to the previously viewed document</li>
<li>"Up" will jump to the start-point of your navigation</li>
<li>"Forward" will will go to the document from where you went "Back"</li>
<li>"Reload" will refresh the current documentation from storage</li>
</ol>
