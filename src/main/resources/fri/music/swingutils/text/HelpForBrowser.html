<h1 id="Browser">HTML Browser Help</h1>
<p>
This is an HTML-browser for viewing the documentations of this application.
</p>
<p>
You can magnify or reduce the text font at any time
using "Ctr +" or "Ctrl -" or the context menu on the text-area.
Once this was done, all views opened afterwards will show the same font sizes. 
</p>
<p>
HTTP-links will be opened in an external web-browser, all others in this view.
</p>

<h2 id="Navigation">Navigation</h2>
<p>
There are four navigation buttons:
</p>
<ol>
<li>"Back" will go back to previous location</li>
<li>"Top" will jump back to the start point of any navigation path</li>
<li>"Forward" will work after "Back" and will go forward to previous location</li>
<li>"Reload" will refresh the current documentation from its storage</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Chapters">Chapters</h2>
<p>
The chapters overview lists all headings in the displayed documentation. 
Opening the choice and clicking an item will jump to the selected chapter.
This is a regular navigation, so "Back" and "Forward" will then work as expected.
</p>

<h2 id="Close">Close</h2>
<p>
To close this window, press ESCAPE key, or click top right corner.
