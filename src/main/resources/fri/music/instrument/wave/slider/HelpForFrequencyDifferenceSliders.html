<h1>See Intervals and Their Difference-Tones on Frequency Sliders</h1>

<p style="margin-left: 10;">
    &rarr; You find information about this topic also in <a href="quicktour.html#FrequencySliders">Quick Tour</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="Tuning">Tuning and Sound</h2>

<p>
    The top bar contains tuning and sound controls.
    Mind that the preset tuning is not <i>EqualTemperament</i> but <i>JustIntonation</i>, 
    because the latter mostly produces cleaner difference-tones.
</p><p>
    If you change the "Tuning", especially between <i>EqualTemperament</i> and <i>JustIntonation</i>, 
    the sliders will keep their positions if they are on a red note label,
    but change positions when not. In any case the frequencies may change.
    The tone C6 (second slider from top) has 1056.000 Hertz in <i>LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC_1 JustIntonation</i>,
    but 1046.502 Hertz in <i>EqualTemperament</i>.
    On the other hand, any "A" (A2, A3, A4, A5, ...) would stay on its frequency, 
    as all tunings are calculated from 440 Hertz (A4), 
    and octave is the only interval that is the same in all tunings.
</p><p>
    The "Wave Form" lets you choose different sounds.
    You can change the sound "on the fly" while the sliders are playing.
    Note that "Sine" is the best wave to produce clean difference-tones,
    as it contains no overtones. 
</p><p>
    Amplitude is the measure of the deflection of the sine wave, 
    this basically can be understood as loudness or volume.
</p><p>
    Gain is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_power">sound power</a>
    of the tone. Be careful with that to not ruin your speakers.
</p>

<h2 id="Control">Control Fields</h2>

<p>
    The second row from top contains display- and control-fields.
    They are connected to the sliders bidirectionally.
</p><p>
    The "Play / Halt 1+2" button starts and stops the sound of the "Play 1" and "Play 2" sliders.
</p><p>
    If you enter IPN note names in "Note 1" and "Note 2" fields,
    the according slider will jump to the frequency of that note.
    The resulting difference-tone will be displayed in "Note 1-2".
    The corresponding "Frequency" fields to the right will show the according frequencies in Hertz.
    You can use CURSOR-UP and -DOWN to jump between semitones.
    When a field is empty it means that the current slider frequency
    does not match the frequency of a regular semitone in the chosen tuning. 
</p><p>
    The "Octaves" field displays the number of octaves the two tones are apart.
    The "Nearest Pure Interval" displays the name of the nearest interval the two tones are apart.
    When it is enclosed in brackets, like e.g. ">FOURTH<", it is a precise matchof the interval.
    It is possible that some intervals never get matched in some tunings, 
    especially in <i>EqualTemperament</i>, because its fractions are not rational
    like those in <i>JustIntonation</i>.  
</p><p>
    The fractions of the intervals are display in the "Pure Fraction" field to the very right.
    If you want to see a certain interval fraction, write it into the "Enter Fraction" field
    and press ENTER. The top slider will then jump to the according position.
</p>

<h2 id="Sliders">Interval Sliders</h2>

<p>
    <b>The accuracy of the sliders is approximately 4 Cents</b>, 
    which is roughly the limit of human perception.
    A semitone has 100 Cent.
</p><p>
    The "Play 1" and "Play 2" fields turn on and off the sound of the according slider.
    The sliders to the right show 12-tone scale note names (IPN) and the frequency 
    where the slider knob currently resides.
    If a note name is red it means that the frequency is exactly the one of the note.
    Semitones have just an arrow ^ as name, but are displayed fully in the text fields on top.
</p><p>
    You can move the the two sliders by mouse drag, 
    or by left mouse click (moves 4 Cent in mouse-direction),
    or by right mouse click onto the desired position.
    Once focussed, the slider knob can also be moved by CURSOR-LEFT and CURSOR_RIGHT.
</p>

<h2 id="DiffToneSliders">Difference-Tone Slider(s)</h2>

<p>
    On bottom you see the frequency of the difference-tone
    that the two interval frequency sliders produce.
    You can start its sound by the "Play 1-2" button. 
</p><p>
    If you move one of the two interval sliders on top, 
    you see that the difference-tone gets higher when the interval gets wider,
    and that it gets lower when the interval gets narrower.
</p><p>
    If you click on the expand bar on top of this slider,
    a panel showing also the secondary and tertiary difference-tone gets visible.
    You may have to size the window to see them fully.
    These are barely audible and are here just for completeness.
    Their formulas are in class <code>DifferenceToneMath</code>, see also
