<h1>Study Chord Beatings in Various Tunings with Frequency Sliders</h1>

<p>
    This application is mainly for studying beatings.
    It provides 4-cent-precise frequency sliders for 
    up to 4 tones playing at the same time.
</p><p>
    The tuning and sound control fields on top are the same
    as in <a href="instrument/wave/slider/HelpForFrequencyDifferenceSliders.html">difference-tone frequency sliders</a>.
</p><p>
    The control fields to the right of the "Play / Halt All" button
    provide quick access to traditional chords.
</p><p>
    All control fields can be changed "on the fly" while the sliders are playing sounds,
    you can also move any slider to another frequency or turn off and on certain frequencies.
