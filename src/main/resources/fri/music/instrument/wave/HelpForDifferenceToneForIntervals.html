<h1>See and Hear Difference-Tones Generated by Various Intervals</h1>

<p>
    Activate "Hold" so that any clicked piano key will create a constant sound.
    Then click a piano key in some upper octave. 
    The configured "Autoplay Interval" tone (above the clicked one) will be added automatically.
    These two interval tones will be marked by a red border.
    The resulting difference-tone will be marked on the piano by its selection color 
    and a red border (in case it is in the keyboard's range).
    Although it looks like, it is <b>not</b> played on the piano,
    it sounds through the interval tones!
</p>
<p>
    To stop the sound, click "Hold" or one of the two piano keys once again.
    You can change any parameter on top while the sound plays.
</p>
<p>
    Try to change the "Autoplay Interval" to MINOR_THIRD while the sound plays
    and watch where the red bordered difference-tone goes on the piano.
</p>
<p>
    When you reduce the "Deviation Tolerance" while playing, 
    you will see that the red bordered difference-tone disappears at some level.
</p>
<p>
    Change the "Tuning" from <i>EqualTemperament</i> to some <i>JustIntonation</i> tuning. 
    You will hear less beatings, because <i>EqualTemperament</i> is not a "pure" tuning.
