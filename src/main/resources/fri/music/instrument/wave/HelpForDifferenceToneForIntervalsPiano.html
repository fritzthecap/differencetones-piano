<h1>See and Hear Difference-Tones Generated by Various Intervals</h1>

<p>
    Activate "Hold" so that any clicked piano key will create a constant sound.
    (To stop the sound, click "Hold" or one of the two piano keys once again.)
    Then click a piano key in some upper octave, e.g. "C5". 
    The configured "Autoplay Interval" tone (above the clicked one) will be added automatically.
    These two interval tones will be marked by a red border.
    The resulting difference-tone to the left will be marked by selection color 
    and a red border (in case the difference-tone is in the keyboard's range).
    Although it looks like, the difference-tone is <b>not</b> played on the piano,
    it sounds through the interval tones!
</p>
<p>
    You can change any parameter on top while the sound plays.
    Try to change the "Autoplay Interval" to MINOR_THIRD 
    and watch where the red bordered difference-tone goes on the piano.
    When you reduce the "Deviation Tolerance" while playing, 
    you will see that the difference-tone disappears at 34 %.
</p>

<h2 id="Tuning">Tuning Example</h2>
<p>
    Activate "Hold", choose "Minor Third" as Interval, choose <i>EqualTemperament</i> as tuning, 
    then click the "C5" piano key, go to 35 % deviation.
    You will see the difference-tone "G2" on the left.
    Now, while the sound plays, change the tuning to <i>LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC_1 JustIntonation</i>.
    The difference-tone on the left will jump to "G#2" (MIDI-number 44).
</p>
<p>
    Even more significant jumps you will get with major-second interval.
    The narrower the interval, the more unpredictable the difference-tone,
    the more dependent it is from tuning.
</p>

<h2 id="Deviation">Deviation Examples</h2>
<p>
    Choosing a fifth will generate the same difference-tone in every tuning.
    But try this: activate "Hold", choose "Fifth", choose <i>EqualTemperament</i> and
    click the "C5" piano key. The difference-tone "C4" will appear on the left.
    Now reduce the "Deviation" slider to 12 %.
    You will see that the difference-tone disappears.
    One click to the right on the slider will change to 13 %, 
    this will make the difference tone appear again.
</p>
<p>
    Most just-intonation tunings need nearly no deviation tolerance to generate
    clean difference-tones (contained in scale), they work with even 0 %.
    But try to choose "Fourth" interval, activate "Hold" and 
    tuning <i>LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC_1 JustIntonation</i>, then click the "A5" piano key.
    You will see no difference-tone at the default 76 % deviation.
    Only when you increase the deviation to 89 %, the difference-tone "D#4" will appear!
    If you try the same with "F5", the difference-tone will disappear on 0 % deviation only.
</p>

<h2 id="SameDiffTone">Same Difference-Tone Despite Parallel Interval Move</h2>
<p>
    Set the deviation to 23 %, choose "Fourth", tuning <i>LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC_1 JustIntonation</i>
    and play the "A#5" piano key. The difference-tone "E4" appears.
    then stop the sound and start it with piano key "B5".
    Again the difference-tone "E4" appears, although the interval made a parallel move one semitone higher!
    If you stop and start "A#5" again and then reduce the deviation to 22 %, the difference tone will disappear,
    although it will still bethere with "B5".
