<h1>See and Hear Difference-Tones Generated by Various Intervals</h1>

<p>
    Activate the "Hold" checkbox on top left, 
    so that any clicked piano key will create a constant sound.
    Then click a piano key in some upper octave, e.g. "C5". 
    The configured "Autoplay Interval" tone, always above the clicked one, 
    will be added automatically, in this case "E5".
    These two interval tones will be marked by a red border,
    the resulting difference-tone to the left will be marked by selection color 
    and a red border (in case the difference-tone is in the keyboard's range).
    Although it sounds as if, the difference-tone is <b>not</b> played on the piano,
    it sounds through the interval tones!
</p><p>
    To stop the sound, click "Hold" or one of the pressed keys once again
    (not the difference-tone!).
    You can change any parameter on top while the sound plays.
</p>

<h2 id="Tuning">Tuning Example</h2>
<p>
    When you change the "Tuning" from <i>EqualTemperament</i> to <i>LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC JustIntonation</i>,
    you will see the difference-tone jump from "C#3" to "C3". 
    This is a good proof for the fact that <i>JustIntonation</i> 
    is more harmonious than <i>EqualTemperament</i>.
</p>

<h2 id="Deviation">Deviation Example</h2>
<p>
    Change the "Autoplay Interval" from "Major Third" to "Minor Third", 
    go back to <i>EqualTemperament</i> and watch the difference-tone.
    When you drag the "Deviation Tolerance" slider to the left, 
    you will see that the difference-tone disappears at 34 %.
</p>
<p>
    Choosing "Fifth" as "Autoplay Interval" will generate the same difference-tone in every tuning.
    But try this: activate "Hold", choose "Fifth", choose <i>EqualTemperament</i> and
    click the "C5" piano key. The difference-tone "C4" will appear on the left.
    Now reduce the "Deviation" slider to 12 %.
    You will see that the difference-tone disappears.
    This is because the fifth is not a clean interval in <i>EqualTemperament</i> 
    (the only clean interval in <i>EqualTemperament</i> is the octave).
</p>
<p>
    Most <i>JustIntonation</i> tunings need nearly no deviation tolerance to generate
    clean difference-tones, most work with even 0 %.
    But try to choose "Fourth" interval, activate "Hold" and 
    tuning <i>LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC_1 JustIntonation</i>, then click the "A5" piano key.
    You will see no difference-tone at the default 76 % deviation (38 Cent).
    Only when you increase the deviation to 89 % (45 Cent), the difference-tone "D#4" will appear!
    If you try the same with "F5", the difference-tone will disappear on 0 % deviation only.
    This shows that F and A are "unjust" tones in <i>JustIntonation</i>. 
    More details about "unjustness" you can find in 
    <a href="../../justintonation/swing/HelpForJustIntonationChecker.html">Check Fraction-Bases Tunings for Purity"</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The narrower the interval, the more unpredictable the difference-tone,
    the more it depends on tuning and deviation tolerance. 
    Mind that the difference-tone is always present, 
    reducing the deviation doesn't remove its sound, 
    only the application doesn't accept it as "just" tone any more.
</p>

<h2 id="SameDiffTone">Same Difference-Tone Despite Parallel Interval Move</h2>
<p>
    Set the deviation to 23 %, choose "Fourth", tuning <i>LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC_1 JustIntonation</i>
    and play the "A#5" piano key. The difference-tone "E4" appears.
    Then stop the sound and click piano key "B5".
    Again the difference-tone "E4" appears, although the interval made a parallel move one semitone higher!
    If you go back to "A#5" and then reduce the deviation to 22 %, the "E4" difference tone will disappear,
    although it will still be present with "B5".
