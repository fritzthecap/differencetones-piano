<h1>Find Out Which Intervals Can Generate a Difference-Tone</h1>

<p>
Click onto a piano key below. A list of all intervals
that can generate the clicked key as difference-tone will be displayed or activated, 
in the possibilities of the piano's tonal range.
(For a melody of 1.3 octaves, e.g. "C4" to "E5",
you will need a piano range of 4 octaves above the lowest tone "C4".)
</p><p>
The difference-tone will be displayed in the title-bar of the list frame.
If you click e.g. "C4" on the piano, the highest displayed interval
will be MINOR_THIRD "[F6 G#6]", the lowest MAJOR_SIXTH "[G4 E5]", 
for tuning <i>EqualTemperament</i>,
deviation tolerance 76 % (38 Cent),
and MINOR_THIRD with MAJOR_SIXTH as narrowest and widest intervals.
</p><p>
Mind that each tuning generates other difference-tones.
If you switch e.g. to <i>JustIntonation LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC_1</i>,
the highest interval will be MINOR_THIRD "[E6 G6]". 
<b><a href="HelpForPianoSettings.html">Tuning, deviation and interval-range</a> 
affect the contents of the interval-lists.</b>
Try to reduce the "Deviation Tolerance" on top bar.
On 34 % (17 Cent) with <i>EqualTemperament</i>, only fourth and fifth will remain as available intervals.

</p><p>
You can close a list by clicking its "X" button in top right corner.
Below the list area there is a bar with actions that let control the lists.
</p>

<h2 id="Actions">List Actions</h2>
<p>
If you click into the title-bar of a list frame, 
the single tone for which the intervals have been calculated will be played on the piano.
</p><p>
If you click onto a list item representing an interval, 
that interval will be played on the piano, and its difference-tone will 
be marked by a red border.
It will sound although not being actually played - that is the nature of difference-tones.
You can hear it best with the "Sine" wave-form, as this has no overtones. 
</p><p>
<i>
Mind that in combination with an 
<a href="../notespiano/wave/HelpForCompose.html">intervals text-area</a>, 
a click onto an interval may write that interval into the text-area.
</i>
</p>

<h3 id="Sort">Sort Lists by Pitch</h3>
<p>
If you deactivate this checkbox, the interval lists will be sorted in the 
order you click the keys on piano. 
</p><p>
If you activate it, the lists will be ordered by the pitch
of their difference-tone, so they will be arranged parallel to the piano keys.
This is useful if you know the structure of a melody by heart and 
want to use the interval lists like piano keys for playing it.
</p>

<h3 id="Reuse">Reuse Open Lists</h3>
<p>
If this checkbox is activated, a piano key will not open another interval list
when clicked a second time. This is useful to keep the number of list frames small.
</p><p>
Its deactivation makes sense when a sequence of tones 
is to be arranged in the order in which they appear in a melody, 
rather than sorted by pitch.
</p>

<h3 id="Detach">Detach Lists</h3>
<p>
If you click this button, the lists will be detached into a dialog window
that can be sized and moved around on the screen.
This provides space for a larger number of list frames. 
The lists will be arranged like text in a flow from left to right, 
having line breaks according to the current size of the dialog window.
</p><p>
Closing the dialog window will move back all lists into the main window.
</p>

<h3 id="Close">Close All Lists</h3>
<p>
As any piano key will open a list, it sometimes will be
useful to close them all together.
</p><p>
<i>
Mind that in combination with a 
<a href="../notespiano/wave/HelpForCompose.html">notes text-area</a>, lists may be reopened 
when their difference-tone is contained in the text-area's melody
and you either click a piano key or edit the text or play the melody.
In this case it may also happen that lists get closed when their difference-tone
is not contained in the text-area's melody.
