<h1>Hear Interval Beatings</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Click the "Hold" checkbox</li>
    <li>Click a piano key, e.g. F5</li>
    <li>An MAJOR_THIRD begins to sound continuously</li>
    <li>You can stop the sound by clicking the F5 key again, or by clicking "Hold" again</li>
    <li>While sound plays ...
        <ul>
            <li>... change to another interval in "Autoplay Interval" choice</li>
            <li>... change to another tuning in "Tuning" choice</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Activate "Hold", choose "Fifth" from "Autoplay Interval", then click
    the "C6" key on the piano. Try to perceive the slow beatings (vibration) of this interval.
    Now, while the sound plays, change the "Tuning" from <i>EqualTemperament</i> 
    to <i>LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC_1 JustIntonation</i> tuning. 
    You will hear significantly less beatings, because <i>EqualTemperament</i> is not a "pure" tuning.
</p>
<p>
    On experimenting you will find out that <i>JustIntonation</i> tunings have much
    less beatings than <i>EqualTemperament</i>.
