<h1 id="Overview">Listen to Auto-Composed Difference-Tone Intervals for Notes</h1>

<p>
    In this application you can enter a melody and then click "Play"
    to hear it as auto-composed difference-tone intervals.
    That means, playing the melody will not play the notes in text-area but
    intervals that have been generated for these notes.
</p>

<h2 id="AutoCompose">Auto-Compose Rules</h2>
<p>
    Now this is something I can't really document, because I am still thinking about it,
    and may be thinking about it even in a year.
    The game is to find a good interval progression that is a counter-movement to the melody,
    but without sounding completely absurd. 
</p><p>
    For this I implemented a strategy-pattern containing a number of rules,
    but it does not work good for all melodies. 
    Like artificial intelligence it makes horrible mistakes.
    (Because I consider this to be an artistic work, I implemented the 
    <a href="instrument/notespiano/wave/HelpForCompose.html">Difference-Tone Composer</a> 
    tool for humans.)
    But here are my auto-compose rules, part of them are implemented.
</p>

<h3>Where to Start</h3>
<p>
    To find a beginning, the melody must be explored in advance.
    Its tone range must be measured, and the available intervals
    for each tone must be drawn from the given tuning or tone-system.
    (remember that different tunings provide different intervals for difference-tones).
</p><p>
    For a tone range of 1.3 octaves we would need about 4 octaves above the lowest
    tone of the melody. For 2.3 octaves it would be 5 octaves, and so on.
</p><p>
    For example, if we have a melody that ranges from C4 to E5 (1.3 octaves),
    and the first tone would be G4, which is about in the middle of the tone range,
    we could take an interval with a middle width (minor-third is narrow, major-sixth is wide).
    Or, if the melody starts with the deepest tone C4, we could start with the narrowest available interval,
    because deep tones come from narrow intervals and high tones from wide intervals.
</p>

<h3>For a Repeated Note Use the Same Interval</h3>
<p>
    When a melody note repeats, do not use a different interval for the repetition.
    Although this may be good in special contexts like a finale, 
    generally it would distort the melody too much.
</p>

<h3>Avoid Parallel Moves</h3>
<p>
    When the melody moves to another note, 
    never do a "parallel" interval-move by using the same interval as before.
    For example, when the melody goes from G4 to A4, 
    do not use the two fifths [G5 D6] and [A5 E6] for that move.
    This is an important rule that prevents from outlining a melody by always the same interval.
</p>

<h3>Do Minimal Moves</h3>
<p>
    The interval is the puppet player, the melody is the puppet.
    Thus the intervals should do minimal moves, ideally the upper tone should
    stay the same, or at least always do a smaller move than the lower tone.
</p>

<h3>Do Counter-Moves</h3>
<p>
    When the melody goes up, the interval should somehow go down,
    and vice-versa. This would go together with "Avoid Parallel Moves".
    Counter-moves are a very old composition technique.
</p>

<h3>Use Patterns</h3>
<p>
    Some melody patterns are easy to generate through intervals.
    For most tunings, the triad arpeggio C4 E4 G4
    could be elegantly generated by [G5 C6] [G5 C#6] [G5 D6].
    The lower tone does not move at all, the upper moves minimally.
    The melody move D4 F4 G4 could be elegantly
    modelled by [A5 D6] [G#5 D6] [G5 D6].
    The upper tone does not move at all, the lower moves minimally.
</p>

<h3 id="StrongIntervals">Use Strong Intervals for Emphasized Beats</h3>
<p>
    The accentuated parts of the melody, e.g. the first beat in bar, 
    it would be recommendable to use clean intervals with simple fractions, 
    which are fourth, fifth and maybe also major-third.
    Other parts of the bar could bear more tension.
