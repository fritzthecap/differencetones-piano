<h1 id="Overview">Write Notes by Piano</h1>
<p>
When you turn on the "Write Notes" checkbox, 
you can use the piano to write notes.
Left click on any key writes to the text-area
at cursor position with a duration that is calculated
from the time the mouse button was down.
Right mouse click opens a context-menu that lets choose
the duration of the clicked piano key and then
writes to the text-area.
</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Use Prepared Examples</h1>
<p>
To see examples, you can open the text-area's context-menu
via right-mouse click and select "Load Examples". 
There is a list of some short note sequences and melodies
that you can use to get familiar with the notes syntax.
Mind that this will overwrite anything being in text-area without warning.
</p>

<h2 id="ABC">Render Notes as ABC</h2>
<p>
The notes language used here is not designed for writing printable music scores. 
Nevertheless you can export the content of the text-area to ABC language
and then render the result on some free ABC converter page on the Internet. 
If you click "ABC Export", a dialog will lead you through that.
</p>

<h1 id="Syntax">Notes Syntax</h1>
<p>
This notes syntax should make it easy to write readable melodies and intervals.
It is not able to carry all the complexities traditional music notations have.
Following are the limited abilities of it.
</p>
<p>
Every note is given as an IPN-name (international pitch notation)
and its duration behind a slash, for example: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>"<b>A4/8</b>" for a eighth note on "A4" (4th octave, pitch 440 Hz)</li><br/>
<li>"<b>E5</b>" for a quarter note on "E5", as the default note-length is "4" and the note ends as "E5/4"</li><br/>
<li>"<b>C#4/2.</b>" for a dotted "C#4" half note (spans three quarter notes)</li><br/>
<li>"-/4" for a quarter rest note</li><br/>
<li>"<b>E5/16~3</b>" for a "E5" triplet sixteenth note 
    (each of the triplets must have the "~3" tilde-postfix!);
    a quarter note triplet MUST start with a quarter note 
    (that may be tied to a subsequent one),
    but it MUST NOT start with an eighth note or a half note, 
    else it will be regarded as eighth or half triplet!</li><br/>
<li>"<b>[C4/4 E4 G4]</b>" brackets for a C-major <b>chord</b>, only the first note needs to have a duration,
for others it is optional but will be ignored</li><br/>
<li>"<b>(G5/1 G5/1 G5/1)</b>" parentheses for a <b>tied</b> "G5" whole note that spans three 4/4 bars</li><br/>
<li>"<b>{A5/4 B5/4 C6/4}</b>" braces for <b>slurred</b> notes</li>
</ul>
<p>
Space must not appear between a note and its duration specification,
but at least one whitespace MUST be between notes.
Spaces are allowed between notes and tie-, slur- and chord-symbols.
</p><p>
Mind that there is no "Eb" or "Bb", you must use "D#" or "A#" instead,
there is no European "H", such is written as "B",
there is no "E#" which is "F", there is no "B#" which is "C".
But you can use both lower or upper case letters in IPN-names.
</p><p>
The <b>tempo</b> may appear as simple BPM-number (beats per minute)
on top of the notes only, it can not change in-between.
It always refers to a quarter note.
</p><p>
The <b>time signature</b> may appear on top of the notes, after the optional tempo, 
or everywhere in-between the melody. It is written as "4/4" or "3/4" or similar,
best in a separate line.
</p><p>
Do not care about bars, the player will automatically calculate bar bounds
using the given time signature(s).
You can use the "Format" button to put every bar into a separate line.
</p><p>
Use context-menu "Clear" or "Ctrl-A" with "DEL" to clear the text-area.
</p>

<h2 id="Ties">Ties</h2>
<p>
Notes connected by a "tie" are notes of same pitch that are played as single note, 
even across several bars.
Ties are started by an opened parenthesis "(" and ended by a closed ")",
notes in between MUST NOT be enclosed in parentheses (no nested parentheses).
</p>

<h2 id="Slurs">Slurs</h2>
<p>
Notes connected by a "slur" are notes of different pitch that are phrased together, 
even across several bars.
Slurs are started by an opened brace "{" and ended by a closed "}",
notes in between MUST NOT be enclosed in "{...}" (no nested braces),
because it is not clear how to phrase several notes that are all slurred together.
</p>

<h2 id="Chords">Chords</h2>
<p>
Chord notes are two or more notes of different pitch that are played simultaneously.
Chords are started by an opened bracket "[" and ended by closed "]", 
just the first note needs to have a duration, it is assumed that all have the same length.
Ties and slurs from inside to outside of a chord are not allowed, but you can tie chords,
even across bars.
</p>

<h1 id="Editor">Editor Actions</h1>
<p>
With right mouse click you can open a context-menu that provides
some useful text-area actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ctrl x</b> for "Cut" selection</li>
<li><b>Ctrl c</b> for "Copy" selection</li>
<li><b>Ctrl v</b> for "Paste" at caret position</li>
<li><b>Ctrl z</b> for "Undo" last action</li>
<li><b>Ctrl y</b> for "Redo" last "Undo"</li>
<li><b>Ctrl a</b> for "Select All" text</li>
<li><b>Ctrl +</b> for bigger font</li>
<li><b>Ctrl -</b> for smaller font</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Player">Player Buttons</h1>
<p>
The arrow buttons beside the text-area will play whatever is in the text-area.
If there is no text or it is invalid, they will be disabled. 
Any of these buttons will stop the player in case it is currently playing sound.
</p><p>
From left to right:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"Rewind" will reset the melody to its start note</li>
<li>"Previous Note" will play the note that was played before the player was stopped,
  it will sound as long as the mouse button is down</li>
<li>"Reverse" will play the melody from end to start (in reverse order)</li>
<li>"Play" will play the melody from start to end, with the recorded note durations</li>
<li>"Next Note" will play the note that comes after the previously played one,
  it will sound as long as the mouse button is down</li>
<li>"Go to End" will jump past the last note of the melody</li>
</ul>
