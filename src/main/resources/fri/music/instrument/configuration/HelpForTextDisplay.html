<h1>Text Displays of Tunings, Difference Tones and Purity Checks</h1>
<p>
    All three tab-panels will generate text output according to the settings you can do.
    Each text window can be closed by pressing ESCAPE when focused, 
    and they all will close automatically when the originator-window gets closed.
</p>

<h2 id="Tunings">Tunings Display</h2>
<p>
    A compound <a href="HelpForTuningsParameter.html">configuration</a> 
    of 12-tone scales provides 
    access to  text output of IPN-names, frequencies, cents and more.
    Please see the "Help" button there on bottom right.
</p>

<h2 id="DifferenceTones">Difference-Tones</h2>
<p>
    In the top part of the panel you can configure the tuning that you want to use
    for calculation of difference-tones and intervals generating them.
</p><p>
    In the middle part you can calculate difference-tones from the interval you can enter
    in the two text-fields.
    Use CURSOR-UP and -DOWN to scroll to adjacent tones.
    The checkbox "Display Only Primary" will control whether you see
    only the primary or also the secondary and tertiary difference-tone 
    in the text output window.
</p><p>
    In the bottom part you can enter a difference-tone in the text-field
    and display all intervals that would generate it, according to the tuning settings on top.
    Use the two choices for narrowest and widest interval to 
    limit the findings. Push the button "Display Intervals" to display 
    intervals that would generate the given tone as difference-tone. 
</p><p>
    The "For a Tone Range" button on bottom opens another configuration dialog
    where you can enter the lowest tone and number of octaves for a whole tone-range 
    you want to display intervals for. Push the "Display Intervals for All"
    button to open a window that shows a <b>table</b> where 
</p><ul>
    <li>every row is a semi-tone within the given range, and</li>
    <li>every column shows an interval that is able
    to generate that tone as difference-tone.</li> 
    <li>Every table-cell either contains 
    the tone-pair that will generate that tone or will be empty when it won't. </li>
</ul><p>
    You can change back to the "Text Displays" dialog and 
    change the <i>tuning</i> and <i>deviation tolerance</i> there. 
    Doing so, you don't need to restart the intermediate "Tone Range" dialog, 
    you can just push the "Display Intervals for All" button once again 
    to display a new result-table for the altered parameters.
</p>

<h2 id="PurityCheck">Purity Check</h2>
<p>
    This is for <i>JustIntonation</i> only.
    The <a href="../../justintonation/swing/HelpForJustIntonationChecker.html">configuration</a> 
    for the check report lets customize the insights into "unjust" intervals and triads
    of these tunings.
    Please see the "Help" button there on bottom right.
