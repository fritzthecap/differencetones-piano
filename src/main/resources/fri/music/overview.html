        <h2>Harmony</h2>
        <p class="newspaper">
            Harmony starts to exist when two or more tones sound at the same time, 
            even when they are very short. 
            It also exists in melodies that play several different tones after each other, 
            but we perceive melodies more as movement, they are the outlines of harmony. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Simple Ratios</h3>
        <p class="newspaper">
            Harmony can be described by ratios of frequencies. 
            <b>The simpler these ratios are, the more beautiful the harmony is perceived to be</b>, 
            this seems to be a law of nature. 
            Doubling a frequency is perceived as the most harmonious interval, 
            the octave with fraction 2/1. The 3/2 fraction of a tone is the fifth, 
            also a simple and beautiful ratio, like 4/3 for the fourth is. 
            The more complex the ratio is becoming, the more cultural is the perception
            of beauty in intervals. The major third as 5/4 may be the first that 
            is perceived as not so harmonious in some cultures, 
            although it is more acknowledged than the minor third with 6/5. 
            Similar to the thirds are the minor sixth (8/5) and major sixth (5/3). 
            Finally there are minor sevenths (16/9, 9/5, 7/4), major seconds (9/8, 10/9) and others,
            but these intervals are no more perceived to be harmonious, they create tension. 
            It needs to be said that the 12-tone scale is not the only one, 
            already hundreds years ago mathematicians recommended to use a 
            53-tone scale to achieve perfect harmony.

        <h3>Beatings</h3>
        <p class="newspaper">
            If you play together a tone with frequency 880 Hertz and another one with 858 Hertz, 
            you will hear vibrations that sound uncomfortable, this is called "beatings". 
            The closer the tones are together, the slower the beat will be. 
        </p>
        <p class="newspaper">
            The mathematician Pythagoras (570 â€“ 495 B.C.) has put fifth over fifth and 
            octaved down the resulting notes until the octave was filled with 12 tones. 
            Euclid (~300 B.C.) then documented that <b>putting 12 fifth on top of each other
            does not result in 7 octaves</b> like expected, well-known as the <b>Pythagorean Comma</b>. 
            So this tuning caused beatings and did not survive the 16th century in Europe 
            when music became an important cultural asset and big instruments were built. 
            At that time church organs were tuned to "just intonation" (pure intonation) 
            that tried to compensate most beatings resulting from the Pythagorean Comma. 
            As this was not sufficient, many more tunings were developed since. 
           <br/>
            Today's resolution for this harmony-problem is to prefer the "equal temperament", 
            where all 12 semitones of an octave have the same distance from each other 
            (namely 100 "cent", which is an artificial unit, one octave has 1200 cent). 
            This distance can not be described by a simple integer fraction any more, 
            and that tuning contains no interval except the octave that sounds perfectly pure.  
            The equal temperament solution may also be related to technical advancement
            in many areas, trying to simplify everything. Fact is that today's <b>equal temperament
            gave up perfect harmony in favor of musical freedom</b> for composers and musicians. 
        </p>

        <h3>Difference Tones</h3>
        <p class="newspaper">
            Beatings are in fact difference tones. 
            These are "shadow tones" that appear when at least two notes are played simultaneously. 
            The closer the tones are together, the deeper (slower) their difference tone will be. 
            The higher these two notes, the easier one can hear the difference tones. 
            The cleaner the playing instruments, the clearer the difference tones, 
            best perceivable through sine wave tones. 
            The more overtones the instruments have, the more do they obstruct the
            difference tones, nevertheless they are always there, and they are
            much lower than the generating high tones. <b>The tighter the high notes
            are together, the deeper the difference tone gets.</b> 
            For 'just' intonation, most difference tones fit perfectly into the scale. 
            Not for equal temperament, where they are nearly all dissonant.  
        </p>

        <h3>Tuning</h3>
        <p class="newspaper">
            Another important fact is that equal temperament fits to all modulations and moves
            music can make, it offers unbound freedom. Not so 'just' intonation. 
            <b>A 'just' scale is built on top of a specific base tone.</b> So when you want to play in 
            'just' intonation, you will have to specify not only the type of your 'just' scale, 
            but also the scale's base note. A 'just' intonation scale is bound to 
            this base tone, all instruments have to tune themselves to this center, 
            and then to the type of scale. In equal temperament no such center exists. 
            Instruments have to tune themselves only to some reference frequency like 440 Hertz (A4).
        </p>

        <h3>Instruments</h3>
        <p class="newspaper">
            Musicians playing melody instruments like violin or saxophone do not have 
            to care so much about harmony. Most of them are well-trained to correct
            frequencies to the harmony playing in the background. 
            In other words, the art of playing a solo instrument is the art of perfectly 
            and quickly adapting to the context harmony through the flexible intonation 
            that these instruments always provide.
            It is different for a piano, a guitar or an organ that <b>can  not adapt its tuning dynamically</b>. 
            These instruments, mostly playing background, do have to care for harmony, 
            else beatings will occur. 
        </p>

        <h3>Pure Intonation</h3>
        <p class="newspaper">
            It is not that we always go forward, now with equal temperament, and that we can
            forget about 'just' intonation. The latter is <b>still widely used</b>. 
            Choirs always use it, because it simply sounds better. 
            A violin player will mostly tune his instrument to 'just' intonation, 
            except when using a tuning device, these normally provide equal temperament. 
        </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p class="newspaper">
            The harmony question is not important in today's
            fast-played and open-minded Jazz/Rock/Pop/Ethno/Fusion music in loud places
            with lots of background noise and small rooms.
            But it matters a lot when coming into a silent big church room
            for a quiet meditation, and the organ begins to play on pipes that generate beatings.
            At any place where people come to listen, not to dance, harmony plays
            a great role, and after thousands years of thinking about tunings
            the game is still not over. Today we know everything and use computers
            to find out the rest. But it turns out that the rest is much bigger
            than what we know. The knowledge about music is immense, and nobody
            can read all the literature that has been written about it in just one life.
            So future will show whether giving up perfect harmony in favor of more freedom will last.
