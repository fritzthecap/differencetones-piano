        <h2>Restrictions of this Sofware</h2>
        
        <p>
            This project is educational. 
            Its intention was not production of anything other than knowledge. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is restricted to 12-tone scales.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can not try out your own 12-tone scale
            except when you implement it and recompile the project,
            currently there is no tool for building scales dynamically at runtime. 
            If you want to implement such, then 
            implement interface <code>ToneSystem</code> or
            extend <code>AbstractToneSystem</code>. 
            For just-intonations, you can add new <code>Intervals</code> and <code>ChromaticScales</code> 
            to class <code>JustIntonation</code>.
