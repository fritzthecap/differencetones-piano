        <h2>Restrictions of this Software</h2>
        
        <p>
            This project is educational. 
            Its intention was not production of anything other than knowledge,
            although you can use it to compose difference-tone melodies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Computer keyboard support is provided very limited,
            no TAB-key order was implemented.
            mostly you will need the mouse to use the user-interface.
            The piano, once having input focus, 
            could be played using TAB- or Shift-TAB and ENTER- or SPACE-keys,
            but actually this is not realistic.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can scale the fonts in all "Help" text views using "Ctrl +" and "Ctrl -" keys or context-menus,
            but you can not scale the fonts of the graphical user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is restricted to 12-tone scales.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can not try out your own 12-tone scale
            unless you implement it and recompile the project.
            In other words, currently there is no tool for building scales dynamically at runtime. 
            If you want to implement a new 12-tone scale, then 
            implement interface <code>ToneSystem</code> or
            extend <code>AbstractToneSystem</code> or <code>AbstractJustIntonation</code>. 
            For the latter, you simply can add new <code>Intervals</code> and <code>ChromaticScales</code> 
            to class <code>JustIntonation</code>.
