            <b>This application gives insight into
            what two tones could do when sounding at the same time.
            Difference-tones are part of

            and are also called

            What you see in the middle of this user-interface 
            is an 
            <a href="swingutils/text/HelpForBrowser.html">HTML-browser</a>
            for viewing the documentations of this application.
            On both sides you see buttons
            that will launch new app windows representing 
            aspects of tunings and difference-tones.
            On most of these windows you will find one or more <b>"Help"</b>
            buttons that provide information or user-guides about what
            you can do with those apps,
            but you can find these documentations also here below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intended audience of this educational project are musicians 
            that want to know more about what's sounding there deep under
            when they bend two high notes on their electric guitar. 
            I also could imagine that small violin- or flute-ensembles 
            might want to try out performing a melody by playing its
            difference-tone intervals instead of playing the melody directly.
            For them, there is the 
            <a href="instrument/notespiano/wave/HelpForCompose.html">"Difference-Tone Composer"</a> 
            app and the "ABC Export" buttons for printing out interval notes on
            some ABC-translator on the web.
            (I am looking forward to hear about the first "Difference-Tone Quartet" of the world !-)

                    Sliders give more freedom than a piano keyboard.
                    You get two frequency sliders (4 cent precision) for two tones of an interval and can watch and hear
                    where their difference-tone slides to.
                    Further you see the <i>JustIntonation</i> tuning calculation ratios.
                    Optionally you can also watch the second and third difference-tone,
                    although these hardly can be heard.

        <h1 id="Me">About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I have been a musician all my life and discovered difference-tones about 40 years ago. 
            Since then I tried to use them in my music.
            As I am a software developer too, I started to experiment with sound wave generators last year.
            This application made me understand that difference-tones are more for electronic music,
            because instruments played by humans will hardly reach the precision
            needed to generate well audible difference-tones.
            Moreover most instruments have so many overtones that the audience would not perceive
            their generated difference-tones - although they are always present like shadows!
