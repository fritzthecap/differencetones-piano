            and are also called <i>"Tartini tones"</i>.

            What you see in the middle of this user-interface 
            is an HTML-browser for viewing documentations of this application.

        <p style="margin-left: 16;"><i>&rarr; For good readability, 
            you can magnify or reduce the text fonts on any text-area

            On both sides of this introduction you see buttons
            that will launch new user-interfaces representing 
            aspects of tunings and difference tones.
            On each of these windows you will find one or more <b>"Help"</b>
            buttons that provide information or user-guides about what
            you can do with those apps.
            You can find these documentations also here below.

        <p>
            Intended audience of this project are musicians 
            that want to know more about what's sounding there deep under
            when they bend two high notes on their electric guitar.<br/>
            I also could imagine that small violin- or flute-ensembles 
            might want to try out performing a melody by playing its
            difference-tone intervals instead of playing the melody's notes directly.
            For them, there is an "ABC Export" button to print according notes on
            some ABC-translator on the web.

                    An algorithm will auto-compose difference-tone intervals for your melody.
                    Enter a melody and press "Play". Mind that the algorithm is quite naive.

        <p>
            I have been a musician all my life and discovered difference-tones about 40 years ago. 
            Since then I tried to use them creatively and integrate them into my music.
            As I am a software developer too, I started to experiment with sound wave generators last year.
            This application made me understand that difference-tones are more for electronic music,
            because instruments played by humans will never reach the precision
            needed to generate clear difference-tones.
            Moreover most instruments have so many overtones that their generated difference-tones
            would not be perceivable by the audience.
