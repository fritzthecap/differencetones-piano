            <b>This application gives insight into
            what two tones could do when sounding at the same time.<br/>
            Difference-tones are part of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_tone">combination tones</a>
            and are also called <i>"Tartini tones"</i>.<br/>
            They are the acoustic equivalent of moir√© patterns.</b>

            What you see in the middle of this user-interface 
            is an HTML-browser for viewing some documentations of this application.

        <p style="margin-left: 16;"><i>&rarr; For good readability, 
            you can magnify or reduce the text fonts on any text-area

            On both sides of this introduction you see buttons
            that will launch new user-interfaces representing 
            aspects of tunings and difference tones.
            On each of these windows you will find one or more <b>"Help"</b>
            buttons that provide information or user-guides about what
            you can do with those apps.

            Intended audience of this project are musicians 
            that want to know more about what's sounding there deep under
            when they bend two high notes on their electric guitar.<br/>
            I also could imagine that small violin- or flute-ensembles 
            might want to try out playing a tune as intervals 
            that generate difference-tones. For them, there is an
            ABC export-button to print notes on some ABC-translator on the web.

        <h2 id="Me">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have been a musician all my life and discovered difference-tones about 40 years ago. 
            Since then I tried to use them creatively and integrate them into my music.
            As I am a software developer too, I started to experiment with sound wave generators last year.
            This application made me understand that difference-tones are more for electronic music,
            because instruments played by humans will never reach the precision
            needed to generate clear difference-tones.
            Moreover most instruments have so many overtones that their generated difference-tones
            would not be perceivable by the audience.
