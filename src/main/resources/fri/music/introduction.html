            <b>This application gives insight into
            what two tones could do when sounding at the same time.
            Difference-tones are part of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_tone">combination tones</a>
            and are also called <i>"Tartini tones"</i>.
            They are the acoustic equivalent of moir√© patterns.</b>

            What you see in the middle of this user-interface 
            is an HTML-browser for viewing documentations of this application.

        <p style="margin-left: 16;"><i>&rarr; For good readability, 
            you can magnify or reduce the text fonts on any text-area

            On both sides of this introduction you see buttons
            that will launch new user-interfaces representing 
            aspects of tunings and difference tones.
            On most of these windows you will find one or more <b>"Help"</b>
            buttons that provide information or user-guides about what
            you can do with those apps.
            You can find these documentations also here below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intended audience of this project are musicians 
            that want to know more about what's sounding there deep under
            when they bend two high notes on their electric guitar.<br/>
            I also could imagine that small violin- or flute-ensembles 
            might want to try out performing a melody by playing its
            difference-tone intervals instead of playing the melody notes directly.
            For them, there is an "ABC Export" button to print interval notes on
            some ABC-translator on the web.
            I am looking forward to hear about the first "Difference-Tone Quartet" of the world!

                    The most important but also the most complex user-interface.
                    You can compose difference-tone intervals for a melody here,
                    or you can click "Auto-Compose" and then adjust the intervals.

                    Click a piano key (in some upper octave) and see 
                    which difference-tone intervals could generate that tone. 
                    Click onto a list item and see which piano keys get activated by it.
                    The difference-tone will have a red border.

                    An algorithm will auto-compose difference-tone intervals for you.
                    Enter a melody and click "Play". Be aware that the auto-compose algorithm is quite naive.

                    Activate "Hold" so that any clicked piano key will create a constant sound.
                    Then click a piano key in some upper octave. 
                    You can change any parameter on top while the sound plays.
                    To stop the sound, click "Hold" or one of the two piano keys once again.

                    This is just for getting familiar with the notes syntax.

        <p>
            I have been a musician all my life and discovered difference-tones about 40 years ago. 
            Since then I tried to use them creatively and integrate them into my music.
            As I am a software developer too, I started to experiment with sound wave generators last year.
            This application made me understand that difference-tones are more for electronic music,
            because instruments played by humans will hardly reach the precision
            needed to generate clear difference-tones.
            Moreover most instruments have so many overtones that their generated difference-tones
            would not be perceivable by the audience.
