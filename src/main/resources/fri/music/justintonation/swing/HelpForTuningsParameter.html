<h1>Tuning Parameters</h1>
<p>
    The tunings display can be customized by a number of parameters.
    Clicking the button "Display Tuning" would open a text window showing the results.
    You can close this window by either the pressing ESCAPE key or clicking the top right corner.
    All open windows would automatically close when you close 
    this configuration window.

<p>
    The 12-tone scale equal-temperament tuning
    and a number of just-intonation tunings are available for inspection.
</p>

<h2 id="Octaves">Number of Octaves</h2>
<p>
    Choose how many octaves you want to display.
    Maximum is 10, but this number also depends on the lowest tone 
    and modal scale start tone you choose.
</p>

<h2 id="Lowest">Lowest Tone</h2>
<p>
    This is the <b>calculation base tone</b>, and the default start tone of the resulting scale.
    It being the start tone may be overridden by "Modal Scale Start Tone",
    but the latter does not play a role in frequency calculations.
</p><p>
    For the <b>equal-temperament</b> scale, the frequency of each tone
    is calculated from the parameter "Frequency of A4" (see below). 
</p>
</p><p>
    For a <b>just-intonation</b> scale, the frequency of the "Lowest Tone"  
    is taken from the parallel equal-temperament scale starting on the given tone in zero-octave. 
    Then the interval fractions are applied to calculate the frequencies of
    all semitones above it. Thus any <b>just-intonation</b> scale depends
    on the frequency of the "Lowest Tone" in an equal-temperament scale, 
    in other words, just-intonation scales are "relative to" some base tone frequency,
    while the equal-temperament scale is "absolute to" the frequency of A4. 
</p>

<h2 id="FrequencyA4">Frequency of A4</h2>
<p>
    You can determine the reference-frequency of note "A4" for all frequency calculations,
    be it for fraction-based just-intonation or for equal-temperament calculations.
    By default, "A4" has 440 Hertz. Historical tuning forks range from 409 to 455 Hertz.
</p>

<h2 id="Modal">Modal Scale Start Tone</h2>
<p>
    This would be the <b>effective start tone</b>, or lowest tone, of the constructed scale,
    applied after all calculations were finished.
    It is allowed to be different from and even below the "Lowest Tone",
    because the equal-temperament frequncy calculation will always create 
    all 10 octaves starting from the zero-octave. 
    This tone is called "modal" because you can determine it also by choosing one
    of the modal scale names like IONIAN, DORIAN, ...
    Its octave will always be the same as the one of "Lowest Tone".
</p>

<h2 id="Columns">Displayed Tone Columns</h2>
<p>
    On this panel you can choose which tuning informations you want to see.
    The title would be a headline reflecting your configuration settings.
    Every choosable column can be activated or deactivated by its checkbox
    and positioned by its left-side order number.
