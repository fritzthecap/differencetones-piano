<h1>Tuning Parameters</h1>

<p>
    The tunings display can be customized by a number of parameters.
    Clicking the button "Display Tuning" would open a text window showing the results.
    You can close this window by either the pressing ESCAPE key or clicking the top right corner.
    All open windows would automatically close when you close 
    this configuration window.
</p>


<h2 id="Name">Tuning Name</h2>
<p>
    The 12-tone scale equal-temperament tuning
    and a number of just-intonation tunings are available for inspection.
</p>

<h2 id="Octaves">Number of Octaves</h2>
<p>
    Choose how many octaves you want to display.
    Maximum is 10, but this number also depends on the lowest tone 
    and modal scale start tone you choose.
</p>

<h2 id="Lowest">Lowest Tone</h2>
<p>
    This is the calculation tone.
    To get to the "Lowest Tone" of a just-intonation scale, 
    first an equal-temperament scale is built, from which the name and frequency
    of the chosen tone is taken.
    Then the interval fractions are used to calculate the frequencies of
    all semitones above that base-tone.
</p>

<h2 id="FrequencyA4">Frequency of A4</h2>
<p>
    You can determine the reference-frequency of note "A4" for all calculations,
    be it for fraction-based ust-intonation or for equal-temperament.
    By default "A4" has 440 Hertz.
</p>

<h2 id="Modal">Modal Scale Start Tone</h2>
<p>
    This would be the start tone, or lowest tone, of the constructed scale.
    It is applied after all calculations were finished.
    It is allowed to be below "Lowest Tone" because the calculation will always
    create all tones starting from the zero-octave.
    But the resulting scale will start with the modal scale start tone.
    It is called "modal" because you can determine it also by choosing one
    of the modal scale names line IONIAN, DORIAN, ...
    Its octave will always be the same as the "Lowest Tone".
</p>

<h2 id="Columns">Displayed Tone Columns</h2>
<p>
    On this panel you can choose which tuning informations you want to see.
    The title would be a headline reflecting your configuration settings.
    Every choosable column can be activated or deactivated by its checkbox
    and positioned by its left-side order number.
