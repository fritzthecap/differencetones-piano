<h1>Tuning Parameters</h1>
<p>
    The tunings display can be customized by a number of parameters.
    Clicking the button "Display Tuning" would open a text window showing the results.
    You can close this window by either the pressing ESCAPE key or clicking the top right corner.
    All open windows would automatically close when you close 
    this configuration window.
</p>

<h2 id="Name">Tuning Name</h2>
<p>
    The 12-tone scale equal-temperament tuning
    and a number of just-intonation tunings are available for inspection.
</p>

<h2 id="Octaves">Number of Octaves</h2>
<p>
    Choose how many octaves you want to display.
    Maximum is 10, but this number also depends on the lowest tone 
    and modal scale start tone you choose.
</p>

<h2 id="Lowest">Lowest Tone</h2>
<p>
    This is the <b>calculation base tone</b>, and the default start tone of the resulting scale.
</p><p>
    To get to the "Lowest Tone" of a just-intonation scale, 
    first an equal-temperament scale is built, based on the zero-octave. 
    From that scale, the name and frequency of the chosen "Lowest Tone" is taken,
    then the interval fractions are applied to calculate the frequencies of
    all semitones above it.
</p>

<h2 id="FrequencyA4">Frequency of A4</h2>
<p>
    You can determine the reference-frequency of note "A4" for all calculations,
    be it for fraction-based just-intonation or for equal-temperament calculations.
    By default, "A4" has 440 Hertz. Historical tuning forks range from 409 to 455 Hertz.
</p>

<h2 id="Modal">Modal Scale Start Tone</h2>
<p>
    This would be the <b>effective start tone</b>, or lowest tone, of the constructed scale,
    applied after all calculations were finished.
    It is allowed to be below "Lowest Tone" because the calculation will always
    create all tones starting from the zero-octave.
    This tone is called "modal" because you can determine it also by choosing one
    of the modal scale names like IONIAN, DORIAN, ...
    Its octave will always be the same as the one of "Lowest Tone".
</p>

<h2 id="Columns">Displayed Tone Columns</h2>
<p>
    On this panel you can choose which tuning informations you want to see.
    The title would be a headline reflecting your configuration settings.
    Every choosable column can be activated or deactivated by its checkbox
    and positioned by its left-side order number.
