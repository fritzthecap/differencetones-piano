<h1>Check Fraction-Based Tunings for Purity</h1>

<p>
    To understand fraction-based frequency calculation, look at table below.
    It lists all notes calculated from C4 (264 Hertz) up to B4 with their fraction and frequency,
    using the fractions of <i>JustIntonation.LIMIT_5_SYMMETRIC</i> tuning.
    (You can verify this using the "Difference-Tones on Frequency Sliders" app.)

<h2>Interval Cent Distances</h2>

<p>
    We have three major thirds in a C-major scale,
    [C-E], [F-A] and [G-B].
    The question rises: has [C-E] the same Cent-distance as [F-A],
    and has [F-A] the same as [G-B]?
    This question rises for every interval.
</p><p>
    For <i>EqualTemperament</i>, all Cent-distances are the same,
    because all semitones have a distance of 100 Cent.
    Its frequencies are calculated by the formula 
</p><p style="margin-left: 20;">
    <code>frequency = frequencyOfA4 * (12th root of 2 power semitoneOffsetFromA4)</code>
</p>
<p>
    In fraction-based tunings it is different,
    because the Cent-distances depend on integer-fractions. 
    Some chords will sound out-of-tune in <i>JustIntonation</i>,
    while others will sound better than in <i>EqualTemperament</i> (less beatings).
    This checker app helps to find out which intervals and triads will sound dirty.
