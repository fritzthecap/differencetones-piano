                <td>
                    An artificial dimension of pitch (tone height).
                    One octave is divided into 1200 Cent, so one semitone is 100 Cent.
                    Humans can perceive inaccuracies of about 4 Cent.
                    You can't convert Hertz (frequency) directly into Cents,
                    because Hertz increase logarithmically and Cents linearly.

                    the secondary with <code>2 * lowTone.frequency - highTone.frequency</code>
                    and the tertiary with <code>3 * lowTone.frequency - 2 * highTone.frequency</code>.

                <td>
                    A difference-tone can be produced by various intervals,
                    e.g. C4 can be produced by [C5 G5] or [G5 C6] or others, 
                    depending on the tuning of the used 12-tone scale.
                    The interval [C5 G5] thus is called a difference-tone inversion,
                    or a difference-tone interval.

                    A 12-tone scale that uses equal distances between semitones (100 cents).
                    The most popular tuning of our times, because it provides the most freedom
                    for modulations into other keys.

                <td>
                    A 12-tone scale that uses different distances between semitones.
                    It is calculated by fractions like 3/2 for fifth, 4/3 for fourth,
                    5/4 for major third, ...
                    The 5-limit tuning is the most popular, well suited for music
                    where harmony is most important.

                    A subdivision of an octave into various numbers of tone steps.
                    12-tone scales divide an octave into 12 steps.
                    "Modal" scales divide an octave into 7 steps.
                    Both use equal or various step distances.

                    Electronic wave generators produce very clean tones with a minimum of overtones.
                    They are particularly well suited for producing difference tones.
                    Popular wave forms are Sine (the cleanest), Triangle, Sawtooth, Square.
