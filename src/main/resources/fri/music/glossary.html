                    An artificial dimension of pitch (tone height).
                    One octave is divided into 1200 Cent, so one semitone is 100 Cent.
                    You can not convert Cents directly into Hertz,
                    because Hertz increase logarithmically and Cents linearly.

                    A difference-tone can be produced by various intervals,
                    e.g. C4 can be produced by [C5 G5] or [G5 C6] or others, 
                    depending on the tuning of the used 12-tone scale.
                    The interval [C5 G5] thus is called a difference-tone inversion,
                    or a difference-tone interval.
