Equal temperament, just intonation, screen pianos, frequency sliders, wave generators - an educational Java/Swing project for musicians interested in difference-tones. It also offers a new way for harmonising melodies, including export to ABC notation from where you can print traditional music scores.

## Read

The documentation / manual is an integrated part of the application, available on the main-window and lots of "Help" buttons. Read it online at 
- [src/main/resources/fri/music/introduction.html](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/fritzthecap/differencetones-piano/blob/main/src/main/resources/fri/music/introduction.html)

## Install

To run the _differencetones-piano_ __desktop-application__, you need at least [Java 17](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/) or better [Java 21](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/) installed on your computer. Java virtual machines are freely available as "Open Java", the JRE (runtime-environment) is enough, you don't need the JDK (development-kit) unless you want to write new code. Check that the executable interpreter (java.exe or java) is in the execution PATH of your operating-system. Run "java -version" to check your installed Java version. Then download the __differencetones-piano-1.0.jar__ file and launch the application via

    cd myDownloadDirectory
    java -jar differenctones-piano-1.0.jar

On some operating-systems it may be possible to run the application by a double click in some file-explorer. There are also _run.sh_ and _run.bat_ platform scripts. 

Mind that this application __does not read/write anything from/to your file-system__ (hard-disk), so please __save your creative work__ by using the text-editor of your choice (that should preserve UNIX-newlines).

## Develop

This is a _Maven 3.6 / Java 21_ project (minimum _Java 17_), developed with _Eclipse 2024-09_. Integration into any Java-able IDE should be easy, there are no external dependencies except _junit-jupiter 6_ in _test_ scope.
