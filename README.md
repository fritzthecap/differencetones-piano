# differencetones-piano
Equal temperament, just intonation, a screen piano, frequency sliders, wave generators - an educational Java/Swing project for musicians interested in difference tones.

I am working on documentation, for now there is only the source code. 
Look at the demo apps in src/main/java/fri/music/demos, for example run "java fri.music.demos.FrequencySlidesDemo" (after compiling all source files).
General information about the topic is in src/main/java/fri/music/package.html.

This is a Maven project. Integration into Eclipse or any other IDE should be easy, there are no external dependencies except JUnit 5.

TODO: 
- add executable JAR file and its build in pom.xml
- compound user interface that guides through intonation topics
- explanatory documentation for each of the demo apps
